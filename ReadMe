## Features:
1. Automatically generates a backend directory structure upon installation.
2. Organizes your backend codebase into logical modules for improved maintainability.

4. Easily customizable to fit the specific requirements of your project.

## Usage

1. **Install Nestify Backend Setup using npm:**
